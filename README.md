# First Raytracer

This is my first go at a ray tracing program, built while working through "Ray Tracing in One Weekend", by Peter Shirley.   Needless to say, it took me more than one weekend.  The code is written in Julia, since I also wanted to explore that language.  In the end I managed to get the "final project" working, although the performance was deplorable, I'm sure as a result of my total lack of Julia knowledge.   Still, a very fun project.
